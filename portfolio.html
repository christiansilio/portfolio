			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
				I am a 21 year old marketing senior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, seeking a full time position post-graduation in any field relating to marketing, marketing analytics, or within the sports industry.
			</p>
			
			<p>My opportunities at the Belk College of Business helped me land an internship at Amwins for the Summer of 2023 in the Charlotte, NC office. I started working for the communications team within the marketing department, where I was tasked with duties consisting of internal and external marketing, social media, data analytics, and Excel database development.
			</p>
			<p>
			I recently got promoted to be the marketing intern of a new division within the company: Amwins Digital. Within this department, I am responsible for creating a variety of graphics and email campaigns to promote new company technologies throughout Q3 and Q4.
			</p>
			<p>
			Additionally, I am currently interning with the UNC Charlotte Women's Basketball team to help them with data analytics and scouting reports for the 2023-2024 NCAA season. I work directly with the assistant coaches, providing detailed reports to help strategize, game-plan, and develop new coaching techniques to help them return to March Madness brackets all around the country.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the Spring of 2023, I participated in the UNCC x Carolina Hurricanes Analytics challenge, where I met with the team's business analytics department and they assigned my team three different tasks to present to them at PNC arena. A month later, I competed in the ESPN x USPS Direct Effect Challenge, where I worked with fellow UNCC marketing students to create an integrated marketing pitch for representatives from the two prestigious companies.
			</p>
			<p>
			All of my experiences within the fields of marketing and analytics have helped me develop a diverse blend of creative qualitative and quantitative skills that I apply to my everyday life.
